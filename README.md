AutoML!
I will add my code for the distributed learning rates search problem.
I am aiming to write this code such that it is easily integratable with different search spaces (such as changing the space from 1e-1 to 5e-5 to 1e-1, 1e-3, ...), different search algorithms, and different evaluation techniques.
